> There is an annoying tendency in the Translation Studies literature to assume that broadening the scope of ‘translating’ beyond interlingual work is an inherently good thing. […] In my view, all-encompassing definitions of an object of study are unlikely to advance knowledge because they must by nature be unfocussed. (90)

If I am to broaden the scope of ‘translating’, then I need to have a clear focus (in my case, this focus is ‘voice’).

As pointed out by Mossop, In translation studies, although we generally limit the discussion of ‘translation’ to ‘interlingual translation’, in contrast to wider definitions such as that of Jakobson , we nonetheless continue to cite Jakobson in our foundational studies. Namely, that the three kinds of translation are “intralingual translation”, “interlingual translation”, and “intersemiotic translation”. [[2403011235 Jakobson's three types of translation]]

Mossop goes on to say that “The wording suggests that he was distinguishing three ways of interpreting a verbal sign, not three ways of translating it” (p 91)

Mossop says we should stop citing this tripartite distinction, since this meaning of ‘translation’ is only relevant to semiotics and linguistics, NOT translation studies.

> The concept of semiosis formulated by the late nineteenth-century American semiotician C. S. Peirce – the process of interpreting one sign (of any kind) by producing another – is simply too general. (pg 77)

Certainly, having no limits or criteria on _what_ is being transferred obfuscates the purpose.

But I argue that logocentrism means that translators miss the forest for the trees.
