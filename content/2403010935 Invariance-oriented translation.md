Mossop draws a distinction between invariance-oriented translation, and variance-oriented translation. The former seeks a high degree of invariance in meaning between the source text and target text (transcreation, adaptation), whereas the latter aims to maintain relative equivalence in meaning, with just a few necessary changes.

We can use this distinction to narrow down the scope of what we mean by 'translation' in intersemiotic contexts (or for our purposes, plurisemiotic) all the while avoiding the semantic ambiguities associated with 'translation' as opposed to 'adaptation', 'transcreation', 'free translation', or any other host of labels. 

Intersemiotic translation, by its very nature, generally involves a a high degree of invariance. For instance, when moving between a painting and a written description, it is common knowledge that "a picture says a thousand words". Even if our written description describes in great detail the composition of the painting, and the figures present, and the colours used, it will still fail to capture the brush strokes, the lighting, and so forth. 

Mossop explains, "The picture is very concrete, but at the same time rather indefinite in meaning. Language is the opposite: abstract but quite definite in meaning. (p 85)" This imbalance means that maintain a high degree of invariance between the visual and the linguistic is impossible.
