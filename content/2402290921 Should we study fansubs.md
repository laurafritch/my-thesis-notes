Scholars like Bogucki argued that amateur subtitling are difficult to critically analyse with scholarly rigour. This is in part due to subtitlers using low quality material (in his case, a poor cam-recorded video). Bogucki states that “[i]f [...] amateur subtitling continues to be done on the basis of incomplete information, it will necessarily also be imperfect and not available to academic study due to its high degree of unpredictability” (Bogucki 2009, 57).

However, Orrego-Carmona (2019) counters this supposition by proposing that the quality of fansubs should not be disregarded based only on their linguistic quality. He argues that academic inquiry should not only consider translational output, but also the translational process, thus giving insight into the 'functional quality' of the text. ([[2402290927 Functional quality]])

## Connections
- Functional quality is understood through [[2402290928 Expectancy norms]]. Both of these theories are pioneered by Chesterman.
- We can analyse functional quality by investigating [[2402290925 Production conditions]] and [[2402290926 Reception conditions]] as per Orrego-Carmona (2019)
- Some pro-am fansubs are just as good as professional fansubs in terms of functional quality and reception ([[2402290934 Functional quality and reception of pro-am subtitles]])
