The ethics of studying non-professional subtitles have also been contested, with some academics contending that it would legitimise an often illegal activity that undermines the profession. Orrego-Carmona (2019) cites Cornu (2013) as one such academic, although I cannot personally comment on Cornu's position due to the writing being in French.

- This would be an argument against studying fansubs. [[2402290921 Should we study fansubs]]
- However, [[2402291006 'Soft' subtitles]] make the study of fansubbing slightly less fraught. In my case, the Takarazuka fan translators are actually very stringent about the distribution and use of their subtitles. They do not hardcode subtitles onto videos and illegally distribute them. Rather, they require that fans first legally obtain a video, and then use the subtitles only for personal (not commercial) use.
