Some non-professional subtitling groups do not hardcode the subtitles into the video and distribute them. Rather, they create 'soft' subtitles. That is to say, they only distribute the plain-text subtitle files (often .srt). 

This mitigates legal issues surrounding the distribution of a copyrighted work (that being the video itself). However, as subtitles are still derivative of the script, this is still an infringement of copyright, at least under American law (Hatcher, 2005)

## Connections
By making subtitles for personal use only, and not distributing the video file itself, fansubs are less ethically dubious. [[2402290956 Ethical Issues related to Fansubbing]]
