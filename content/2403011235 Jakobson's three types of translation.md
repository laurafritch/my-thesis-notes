In 1959, semiotician Roman Jakobson (1896–1982) proposed three types of translation: “intralingual,” or the rewording of verbal signs (a spoken or written text) within a single language; “interlingual” (the interpretation of verbal signs in one language by the verbal signs in another language); and “intersemiotic” (the interpretation of verbal signs by a nonverbal system) (Jakobson, 1959: 233)
