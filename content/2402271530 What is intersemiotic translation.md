Mossop defines intersemiotic transposition as “the creation of material in one medium (paint, video), art (film, literature, architecture) or sign system (language, music, mathematics) starting from material in another.” (p 78). 

He distinguishes it from multimedia translation, which involves the translation of linguistic material into another language, and (should) involve consideration of non-linguistic components of the source material. Mossop notes that a “good translator” of song lyrics would consider not only how to transfer the meaning, but also the musicality. However, Mossop makes the point that this is interlingual, not intersemiotic. 

## Connections
- Here is the problem of using words like ‘multimodal’ or ‘intersemiotic’. The word ‘plurisemiotic’ (see [[2402271529 What is Plurisemiotic Translation]]) allows us to talk about multimedia translation AND intersemiotic translation.
