Reflecting upon his previous research on the reception of non-professional subtitles, Orrego-Carmona (2019) notes that participants indicated that accessibility and speed were important factors in accessing subtitles, not just typical notions of quality. Indeed, he found that subtitles are often downloaded soon after they are made available. This is illustrative of the value placed on speed.

For the viewers of this kind of content, it seems that subtitles are primarily about accessibility. They value fast circulation and access. NPS subtitles fulfill these needs and expectations.
