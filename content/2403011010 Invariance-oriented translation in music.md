After considering four criteria for maximising invariance in intersemiotic translation (namely, back-translatability, regular correspondences, freestandingness, and having Few Additions and Few Subtractions 'FAFSness'), Mossop concludes that the discipline of musicology (rather than film studies) is fertile for inquiry into intersemiotic translating.
