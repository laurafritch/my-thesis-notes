In an experiment on the reception of non-professional subtitles, fifty-two native speakers of Catalan or Spanish were shown excerpts from *The Big Bang Theory*. Two  versions were non-professional subtitles, and one was official. The factor of source-language proficiency was also controlled for by including participants with a high proficiency in English, as well as participants with low proficiency. 

Upon testing the comprehension and recall of the narrative, it was found that there was no different between those who watched professional subtitles and those who watched the non-professional subtitles.

## Connections
- We should not disregard the study of fansubs simply on the basis of their linguistic quality; we should also consider the [[2402290927 Functional quality]]
- However, even with regards to linguistic quality, the reception of the subtitles from this experiment indicate that funsubs are not inherently poor quality.
