Mossop asks the question: what intersemiotic works maximise invariance? He considers four criteria other than maximising invariance. These are

1. Back-translatability
2. Regular correspondences (”many items in the source material are frequently translated by one particular item in the target system”)
3. Freestandingness (the derived material can be interpreted without reference to the source or any other signifying material)
4. FAFSness (the translation has at most a Few Additions or a Few Subtractions with respect to the source as a whole – a quantitative criterion)

These criteria are also easily applied to interlingual work. Mossop explains that he selected these criteria since Translation Studies continues to be centred on interlingual works, and so he is utilising existing lines of inquiry.

This doesn’t seem particularly innovative to me though.

He further explains that his motivation for selecting these criteria is that they underscore a clear relationship between the source and target. Mossop rejects the idea that adaptations with weak or vague references to the source should be called ‘translations’ at all, instead asserting that this is the realm of semiotics, not Translation Studies.
