Although the poem was written while Kenji was sick in bed, his handwriting looks far from it. He wrote in large, bold letters. We can sense a desperate strength in his writing.

It is also written largely in katakana, rather than hiragana. This is indicative of the time period.

The script, and the way it was written, add a layer of meaning to the poem.
