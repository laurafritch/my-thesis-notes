Technological advances and the proliferation of collaborative translation practices through the internet have seen an increase in ‘non-professional subtitling’. This translation practice, underscored by the volunteer/amateur status of its practitioners, has been variously termed by scholars as 
>“community translation”, “social translation” (O’Hagan 2011), “volunteer translation” (Pym 2011) and “collaborative translation” (Fernández Costales 2012).

(list taken from list taken from Orrego-Carmona, D. (2019).)

The structure and nature of social translation is varied, but a common trait, as identified by O’Hagan (2009), is the empowerment of the users, as ‘prosumers’. Not only do they produce translations, but they are also consumers themselves. They are part of the community of users.

As Cronin explains, 
>“[i]t is no longer a question of the translator, for example, projecting a target-oriented model of translation on to an audience, but of the audience producing its own self-representation as a target audience” (2012, 100).
